## Introduction

**MAX-DETOX-LIFESTYLE-BLACKOUT** is a curated collection of domain blocklists designed for [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), a network-level ad and content blocker. These lists go beyond traditional ad blocking—they target websites and services that promote unhealthy consumption patterns, impulsive spending, and manufactured wants.

### What Are These Lists?

These blocklists contain domain names of:
- **Fast food chains** and **food delivery platforms** that make unhealthy eating effortless
- **Beauty and cosmetics retailers** that drive overconsumption through manufactured insecurity
- **Major conglomerates** (Nestlé, Unilever, P&G, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo) that dominate markets and choices

Each list is formatted for Pi-hole compatibility, containing one domain per line with organized sections for easy review and maintenance.

### Why Use These Lists?

In a world where corporations exploit our psychology for profit, this project stands as a digital shield against unhealthy lifestyle enablers and financial blackholes. These blocklists help you reclaim control over your attention, health, and finances by blocking domains that promote:

- **Ultra-processed foods** that damage your health
- **Predatory delivery services** that drain your wallet  
- **Beauty industry manipulation** that preys on insecurity
- **Mega-conglomerates** that control markets and choices

This is not just about blocking websites—it's about reclaiming autonomy over your digital life and breaking free from engineered consumption patterns.

### What is Pi-hole?

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is a DNS-level content blocker that works at the network level, protecting all devices on your network (phones, tablets, smart TVs, etc.) without requiring individual software installation. When a device tries to access a blocked domain, Pi-hole intercepts the DNS request and prevents the connection.

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

Since your Pi-hole blocks domains in the blocklist, run analysis scripts in a Docker container with external DNS:

```bash
# Build and start the container
exec/start.sh

# Run analysis scripts inside container (bypasses Pi-hole DNS)
exec/analyze.sh

# Or run the complete workflow
exec/full-workflow.sh

# Stop container when done
exec/stop.sh
```

**Quick commands:**
```bash
exec/analyze.sh                      # Analyze domains for hazards
exec/check-variations.sh             # Check for TLD variations  
exec/add-variations.sh               # Add verified variations
exec/apply-recommendations.sh        # Apply cached recommendations
exec/generate-ultra.sh               # Regenerate master blocklist
exec/shell.sh                        # Enter container shell
```

The container uses Google DNS (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) instead of your Pi-hole.

**Note for macOS users:** The start script automatically configures Colima to mount `/Volumes/mnt` for access to your project files.

python3 analyze_domains.py --test --category food --sample-size 10
```

**Options:**
```bash
--sample-size N, -n N     # Analyze N domains per category (default: 5)
--all, -a                 # Analyze ALL domains
--force, -f               # Force reanalysis, ignore cache

### Test Mode

All analysis scripts support `--test` mode for safe experimentation:

**Directory Structure:**
```
research/
├── data/
│   ├── food_delivery_data.json           # Production
│   ├── cosmetics_beauty_data.json
│   ├── conglomerates_data.json
│   └── test/
│       ├── food_delivery_data.json       # Test
│       ├── cosmetics_beauty_data.json
│       └── conglomerates_data.json
├── cache/
│   ├── analysis_cache.json               # Production cache
│   └── test/
│       └── analysis_cache.json           # Test cache
└── reports/
    ├── food & delivery_analysis.html     # Production reports
    └── test/
        └── food & delivery_analysis.html # Test reports
```

**Use test mode when:**
- Testing fixes for analysis failures (threading errors, timeouts)
- Experimenting with Playwright settings
- Iterating on content access strategies
- Testing User-Agent rotation or timeout adjustments
- You don't want to affect production cache/results

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Test a fix on a small sample
./exec/analyze.sh --test --category food --sample-size 10

# If successful, run on more domains
./exec/analyze.sh --test --category food --sample-size 50

# Once confident, apply to production
./exec/analyze.sh --category food --all

4. No gravity update needed—takes effect immediately

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this break anything on my network?

These lists are narrowly targeted at specific consumer services. They should not affect:
- Email, social media, or essential services
- Banking, healthcare, or government websites
- News, entertainment, or productivity tools

If something breaks, you can always whitelist specific domains or temporarily disable the lists.

### Can I use these without Pi-hole?

These lists are formatted for Pi-hole but can potentially work with other DNS-based blockers (AdGuard Home, dnscrypt-proxy, etc.). However, instructions and testing focus on Pi-hole.

### Do I need all the lists?

No! Start with just one (e.g., `food.txt`) and add more as needed. The modular approach lets you customize your blocking level.

### How often are lists updated?

Pi-hole automatically checks for updates weekly. When new domains are added to the GitHub repository, they'll be downloaded during the next update cycle.

### What if I need to order food delivery occasionally?

You can:
1. Temporarily disable the list in Pi-hole (Group Management → Adlists)
2. Whitelist specific domains you need
3. Use a different device/network not protected by Pi-hole
4. Disable Pi-hole entirely for a few minutes (Dashboard → Disable button)

### Will this slow down my internet?

No. DNS blocking happens at the DNS lookup stage and actually speeds up browsing by preventing connections to blocked domains entirely.
